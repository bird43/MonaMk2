# MonaMk2
Library for the Mona mk2

A c++ library (Arduino) writen by Ben Bird for a differential drive robot designed by Farshad Arvin at the University of Manchester.

Library can eaily be used to provide low level control of any differential drive robot by simply changing the pin definitions. Your hardware will require encoders connected to interrup pins.

An untested ROS main file is included in the examples, will test in a few weeks.
